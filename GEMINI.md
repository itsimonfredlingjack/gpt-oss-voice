# Google Home Hack

This project is a set of Python scripts designed to integrate a local AI (via Ollama) and system monitoring with a Google Home device (specifically targeting a device named "Kontor") using Chromecast for audio output. It essentially creates a voice-activated (or at least voice-responding) AI assistant and system monitor for a home server environment.

## Key Components

*   **`speak.py`**: The core text-to-speech module. It connects to a Google Home device using `pychromecast` and streams audio generated by Google Translate's TTS service.
*   **`brain.py`**: The AI "brain". It connects to a local Ollama instance running the `gptoss-agent` model. It takes user input, gets a response from the AI, and uses `speak.py` to vocalize that response.
*   **`monitor.py`**: A system monitoring script. It checks CPU, RAM, and Disk usage using `psutil` and vocalizes a status report via `speak.py`.

## Requirements

### Software
*   **Python 3**
*   **Ollama**: Must be running locally on `http://localhost:11434`.
    *   Model required: `gptoss-agent` (referenced in `brain.py`).

### Python Dependencies
Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install requests pychromecast psutil
```

### Hardware
*   A Google Cast-enabled device (e.g., Google Home, Nest Mini) named "Kontor" on the same network.
    *   *Note: The device name can be changed in `speak.py`.*

## Usage

### 1. Speaking (TTS Test)
Send text directly to the speaker:
```bash
python speak.py "Hej, detta är ett test."
```
If run without arguments, it says "Systemet online. AI servern är redo."

### 2. AI Assistant ("The Brain")
Interact with the AI model.

**Interactive Mode:**
```bash
python brain.py
```
Type your prompts in the terminal, and the response will be spoken out loud.

**One-off Command:**
```bash
python brain.py "Vad är meningen med livet?"
```

### 3. System Monitor
Check server health and have it read aloud:
```bash
python monitor.py
```

## Configuration

*   **Target Device:** Change `DEVICE_NAME` in `speak.py` to match your Google Home device name (e.g., "Sovis", "Vardagsrum").
*   **AI Model:** Change `MODEL_NAME` or `OLLAMA_URL` in `brain.py` if you use a different Ollama setup.
*   **Language:** The system prompt in `brain.py` and TTS in `speak.py` are hardcoded for Swedish (`tl=sv`).
